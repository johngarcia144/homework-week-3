Password Generator

For this week's project, we were given an HTML and CSS file and told to create a random password generator by creating our own JS file. While the criteria was simple, executing it in our javascript file was extremely difficult. The password needed the option to have lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and symbols. I started the project with a heap of confidence, then fiddled around for a few days before getting serious. Turns out should have gotten serious a long time ago.

I began by pseudocoding out the problem as best I could, but it turned out creating all the arrays, loops, and functions was almost impossible for me without looking back at past acticivities, and using my "google-fu" to find answers. I realize, as many have told me, this is a huge part of being a coder - looking elsewhere for answers. I have found it's a good skill to know what quesitons to ask, i.e. how would I create this loop, instead of how do you get the information onto the page.

I had a few false-starts, including a few hours looking into ASCII character codes, before creating longer arrays and going from there. And once the password generated, I created a simple copy to clipboard button. 

Overall, this was insanely hard for me. But I'm proud I was able to finish.
